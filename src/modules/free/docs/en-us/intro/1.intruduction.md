FreeEIS is a scalable, enterprise-level information system development framework. FreeEIS is designed to solve the increasingly popular problem of system disassembly and assembly in remote collaborative development. And by accumulating more and more functional modules, the system is built faster.

## Background
```
 - Remote collaboration has become a clear trend, especially in the field of software development. Under the influence of the epidemic, this trend is becoming more and more pronounced. Many people actively or passively work from home to collaborate remotely with their teams.
 - Freelancing is another trend, and more and more people will prefer to freely choose short-term work content rather than being "tied to" an organization for a long time.
 - Many enterprises, especially small and medium-sized software enterprises, are facing the problem of difficult management of technical teams. On the one hand, remote work increases the cost of team communication, and on the other hand, the collaboration of different types of team members (local, remote, part-time, etc.) makes it difficult to split the project.
```

## Target

We expect to achieve the following goals:
 - Anyone with a basic technical background can quickly set up a working web system and focus on designing new features in specific areas!!
 - "Force" developers to build universally available functional modules to improve reuse and reduce subsequent costs.
 - Full front-end and back-end support, full-stack, detachable.
 - Easily split a large project into multiple independent modules and assign them to any type of team member without developers having to think about other parts of the system.
 - Each module is flexible and scalable enough to be a massive system in its own right, a small reusable component or just a simple tooling approach.
 - Modules are completely independent of each other.
 - Modules can work together with simple (or no configuration) between them.
 - By implementing basic functional modules, the general project only needs to consider the business logic of the specific domain.
 - Through certain specifications, functional modules developed by anyone can be directly referenced.
 - Expand domain-specific functional modules to simplify the implementation of industry solutions.

## Structure

FreeEIS believes that any functional module can be universal, but the scope of the general is different. If the generality is not considered in the development, the cost of doing as many projects as many projects is equally high, and if the generality is considered, the development cost will decrease as the number of accumulated modules increases. (Reuse is a very common concept in the developer's head, but in reality, it is not easy to do well.) We allow a module to be bad, but make it very easy to replace or modify a bad module. Ôºâ

FreeEIS was defined as: one base + one set of generic modules + one set of custom modules = one system.

 - A pedestal that refers to the kernel module and project scaffolding.
 - A set of general modules, which refer to the functions that need to be considered in most systems, such as dictionary management, log management, menu management, system configuration management, error code management, account management, organization management, role management, permission control, etc. FreeEIS will gradually implement these common functional modules, expanding the scope where possible.
 - A set of customized modules, which refers to the "non-generic" functional modules in specific business needs, which need to be customized and developed by the development team according to customer needs. However, in the development of these modules, it is still possible to consider implementing them as "relatively" generic modules for use by other businesses or others.

Obviously, the larger the number of general-purpose modules, the fewer modules that need to be customized and the lower the development cost.

## Features


- üõ† High scalability

"Everything" can be a module, from a beautiful button, a simple arithmetic function, to a complete ERP system, can be used as a module in FreeEIS. Flexible module splitting, zero coupling between modules, module plug and play. At the same time, considering the extensibility of the module itself, the module can be developed as a "plug-in" for another module.

- üéØ Focus on business logic

The FreeEIS kernel prefabricates functions that are not related to business logic, so that developers only need to consider the business logic inside the module, such as module loading, reference dependencies, multi-language support, multi-style support, data model generation, permission management and control, route generation, mock function, etc. have been built into the FreeEIS kernel, and there is no need to consider it during module development. In particular, parts such as data model generation, permission management and control, which usually consume a lot of developers' energy, have also been stripped and decoupled, greatly improving development efficiency.

- üöÄ Quick integration

All functions in FreeEIS are split into large and small modules, when it needs to be integrated into a complete system, only need to configure the required modules, or put the module code (directory) in a unified location, FreeEIS kernel will automatically load all required modules, and integrate into a complete system. This makes system-level assembly more flexible and can be integrated into complete systems of completely different sizes and functions as quickly as needed.

- üçπ Do not change development habits

FreeEIS tries its best to achieve less packaging and no SDK, so as to avoid changing existing development habits. A scaffolding project + a simple set of specifications enables rapid system development.

- üö™ Code security

In some scenarios, we don't want all developers to get a lot or even all the code of the functional module before they can run and debug their own functional module. FreeEIS is designed so that developers only need to access the code base of their own functional modules, which can ensure code security without affecting development.


## Usage

### Prerequisites

In the current version, the front-end uses the following technologies or frameworks, which you need to have knowledge of or even experience with:
 - [VUE3] (https://vuejs.org/) is the basis for our entire front-end section.
 - [Quasar Framework] (https://quasar.dev/) is a VUE-based framework with a variety of features, such as rich components, support for Material Design, support for cross-platform, and so on. However, FreeEIS does not prohibit the use of other component libraries, you can still choose according to your preference, we just use the scaffolding and cross-platform support of the Quasar Framework, and even you can use FreeEIS in other VUE projects that have nothing to do with the Quasar Framework.

In the current version, the backend uses the following technologies or frameworks, which you need to have knowledge of or even experience:
 - [NodeJS] (https://nodejs.org/) is the foundation!
 - [ExpressJS] (http://expressjs.com/) is the foundation of üòâ the foundation.
 - [MongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com/), [Mongoose] (http://www.mongoosejs.net/), The database operation modules that have been implemented so far are based on Mongoose, but we expect to add more database support in the future.
 - [Redis] (https://redis.io/), it is recommended to use Redis' docker image deployment.

### Frontend

```sh
# Install front-end scaffolding

$ git clone https://github.com/freeeis/free-fe-starter-kit.git fe

# Install dependent packages
$ cd fe
$ yarn install

# Run
$ yarn start

```

### Backend

Before using the backend, install MongoDB and Redis, or you can use a remotely deployed instance, whose addresses and ports are configured with the relevant built-in modules of FreeEIS. In addition, Redis is not required, if you cannot connect to Redis, FreeEIS will use [memory-cache](https://github.com/ptarjan/node-cache#readme) as a cache, which will not affect development or running.

```sh
# Install back-end scaffolding

$ git clone https://github.com/freeeis/free-be-starter-kit.git be

# Install dependent packages
$ cd be
$ yarn install

# Create files to store confidential data (can also be created manually)
$ touch global.js

# Run
$ yarn start

```

### Access the system

After successfully running the front-end and back-end projects, access the system via the link [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). You can also modify the configuration so that the front-end automatically opens the page from the browser after running.

## Built-in function modules

We hope to simplify the work of developers by providing some built-in functional modules, such as account management, permission control, which are required in any system, and we have made modules that can be directly referenced. Below is a list of the built-in feature modules we currently offer, as well as their features. Of course, according to our purpose, we do not force you to use any of the built-in modules, you can customize and develop all the required modules according to your needs, but just use the specifications of FreeEIS and use her to assemble the system. And we encourage you to do so, because we believe that there are many more professional developers in any field than we are, and we want more people to develop more and more powerful functional modules for others to use.
